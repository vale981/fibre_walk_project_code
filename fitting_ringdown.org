#+title: Python Code for the Fibre Loop Experiment

This is the code for the experimental side of [[id:bbd22b2d-4fcd-4ea9-9db7-8d599511a815][Simulation of Open
Systems with Fiber Loops]].

It contains some analysis code which is discussed in separate notes
and a partial re-implementation of the [[id:c45097d2-2599-426d-82db-6ecfb5207151][Julia Code Project for the Non-Markovian Quantum Walk in Fiber Loops]].
